    "content": "Chase Steely looked at the rare book in his hands and felt shocked. He walked over to the window and reflected on his remote surroundings. He had always loved breathtaking Book Stores in the mountains of Patagonia with its miniature, misty mountains. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel shocked.Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Daniel Blacksmith. Daniel was a proud author with grey eyes and slim fingers. Chase gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a generous, helpful, beer drinker with handsome eyes and charming fingers. His friends saw him as a helpful, harsh hero. Once, he had even helped a skinny puppy cross the road. But not even a generous person who had once helped a skinny puppy cross the road, was prepared for what Daniel had in store today. The chilly teased like smiling elephants, making Chase confident. As Chase stepped outside and Daniel came closer, he could see the evil glint in his eye. Daniel gazed with the affection of 6995 clever melted monkeys. He said, in hushed tones, I want an adventure. Chase looked back, even more confident and still fingering the rare book. Daniel, I love books, he replied.

Then Daniel came inside for a nice drink of beer. THE END "
