    "content": "Chase Steely looked at the rare book in his hands and felt shocked. He walked over to the window and reflected on his remote surroundings. He had always loved breathtaking Book Stores in the mountains of Patagonia with its miniature, misty mountains. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel shocked.Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Katie Blacksmith. Katie was a proud author with grey eyes and slim fingers. Chase gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a generous, helpful, beer drinker with handsome eyes and charming fingers. His friends saw him as a helpful, harsh hero. Once, he had even helped a skinny puppy cross the road. But not even a generous person who had once helped a skinny puppy cross the road, was prepared for what Katie had in store today. The chilly air teased like smiling elephants, making Chase confident. As Chase stepped outside and Katie glared, she could see the evil glint in his eye. Katie gazed with the intensity of 6995 clever melted monkeys. She said, in hushed tones, I want an adventure. Chase looked back, even more confident and still holding the rare book. Katie, I love books, he replied. They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two rare, rapid rabbits loving at a very optimistic snow storm, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two splendid uncles thinking to the beat. Then Katie came inside for a nice drink of beer. THE END "
